# Warning

* The cut-off function used should be same in XMAT files, GENPOT and  Lasso files
* There should be spacing after values used in input file
* While running GENPOT be careful  to lookout for lammps compilation warning. This is caused by a explicit definition of NMAX value in PLIP code.
* Warning : **Atomic species are hard coded**
> Change mass and atomic number in GENPOT; In XMAT change atom type
* Warning : The order of species in POSCAR as XMAT can't differentiate the order.
