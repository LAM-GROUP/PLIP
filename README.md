`PLIP` (Physical LassoLars Interactions Potential) is a Python package for machine learning interatomic potentials for materials modelling. Physical Lasso-Lars Interaction Potential (PLIP) has been developed to address the lack of interpretability of MLIPs. PLIP uses a physically motivated mathematical formulation for the potential and a constrained linear regression to fit the linear coefficients that determine the preponderance of each contribution to the potential. The MLIP is constructed as a linear combination of classical interactions, including two-body, three-body, and many-body interactions. These interactions are made up of simple functions such as Lennard-Jones, Gaussian, and Slatter-type orbitals, as well as explicit angular functions and embedded atom-like interactions. The Lasso-Lars regression used in PLIP imposes most coefficients to be equal to 0, resulting in a simplified final expression that retains only the main physical nature of the interactions.
# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/LAM-GROUP/PLIP.git
cd  plip
pip install -e .
```

# Short description of PLIP code

 The method consists of 3 steps:

* **XMAT** 

    Construct matrices with each row corresponding to a force (X,Y,Z) on a specific atom and each column corresponding to a descriptor. The input arguments required are:

 
* **Lasso**

    Read the matrices and the DFT forces to construct the PLIP using LassoLars. 

* **GenPot**

    Read the obtained linear coefficients and construct the LAMMPS file for the potential.
