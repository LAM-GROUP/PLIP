`PLIP` (Physical LassoLars Interactions Potential) is a Python package for machine learning interatomic potentials for materials modelling. Physical Lasso-Lars Interaction Potential (PLIP) has been developed to address the lack of interpretability of MLIPs. PLIP uses a physically motivated mathematical formulation for the potential and a constrained linear regression to fit the linear coefficients that determine the preponderance of each contribution to the potential. The MLIP is constructed as a linear combination of classical interactions, including two-body, three-body, and many-body interactions. These interactions are made up of simple functions such as Lennard-Jones, Gaussian, and Slatter-type orbitals, as well as explicit angular functions and embedded atom-like interactions. The Lasso-Lars regression used in PLIP imposes most coefficients to be equal to 0, resulting in a simplified final expression that retains only the main physical nature of the interactions.

# Short description of PLIP code

 The method consists of 3 steps:

* **XMAT** 

    Construct matrices with each row corresponding to a force (X,Y,Z) on a specific atom and each column corresponding to a descriptor. The input arguments required are:

  1. The file **input.txt** that summarizes the list of descriptors. 
 
  2. **Input/** folder with all the input files for the database  
 
* **Lasso**

    Read the matrices and the DFT forces to construct the PLIP using LassoLars. For that purpose, the "lammpsstrj" (forces) and the "bin" (descriptor) files must be moved respectively to "Input/" and "Input_1/" and one needs to run "./xLasso". We test different values for alpha and results are moved in a folder "Output_1/"

* **GenPot**

    Read the obtained linear coefficients and construct the LAMMPS file for the potential. The "Coeff???.txt" file that is given by "2_Lasso" must be moved in the root of the folder and the code is the run with "./xGen"

Once the potential is obtained, one can start running LAMMPS simulations. For that purpose, the files obtained with GenPot are moved in "4_MD/zPOT".
